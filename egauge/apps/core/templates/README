This folder is for APP specific templates.
Templates that are specific to the project will be in the apps/app_name/templates/app_name/.

Related app static assets should go in ../static_assets/css & ../static_assets/js
The goal is to be able to make the app shipable without the specifics to our site.
Anything that is site wide should be in the site wide template & static folder located ../../../templates & ../../../static
