This folder is for site wide templates only.
Put the base.html, 404.html, & 500.html in this folder.
Templates that are specific to the project will be in the apps/app_name/templates/app_name/.
Related site wide static assets should go in ../static_assets/css & ../static_assets/js

The goal is to be able to make the app shipable without the specifics to our site.
So app related templates & static assets would go in ../app/app_name/templates/app_name
& ../app/app_name/static_assets/js ../app/app_name/static_assets/css
