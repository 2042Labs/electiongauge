Well, look, I think what Republicans have to ask is, who&rsquo;s most likely in the long run to survive against the kind of billion-dollar campaign the Obama team is going to run? And I think that a bold Reagan conservative, with a very strong economic plan, is a lot more likely to succeed in that campaign than a relatively timid, Massachusetts moderate who even the Wall Street Journal said had an economic plan so timid it resembled Obama. : No, I don&rsquo;t believe he&rsquo;s unelectable, but I think he has a -- look, against Obama&rsquo;s record, I think, you know, the fact is, President Obama is going to have a very hard re-election effort. But I do think the bigger the contrast, the bolder ideas, the clearer the choice, the harder it is for that billion-dollar campaign to smear his way back into office. : I think he will have a very hard time getting re- elected -- getting elected. : Well, yeah. Mitt, I realize the red light doesn&rsquo;t mean anything to you, because you&rsquo;re the frontrunner.: Well, the fact is that the Ryan-Wyden bill, which was just introduced recently, actually incorporates allowing people to choose and allows them to stay in traditional Medicare with the premium support model or go to new methods. And I think it&rsquo;s a substantial improvement, because it allows for a transition in Medicare in a way that makes sense.: -- to actually improve the government, not punish the American people because of the failure of the political class to have any sense of cleverness. : I think every president who works with the leader of every opposition knows they&rsquo;re working with someone who wants to make them a one term president. I mean you know that -- that&rsquo;s the American process. I worked with Ronald Reagan in the early 1990&rsquo;s. Tip O&rsquo;Neil was speaker. He wanted to make Reagan a one term president. We had to get one-third of the Democrats to vote for the Reagan tax cuts and we did.: Well, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an easy answer. I think that&rsquo;s a statement of fact. : If you look at the EPA&rsquo;s record, it is increasingly radical. It&rsquo;s increasingly imperious. It doesn&rsquo;t cooperate, it doesn&rsquo;t collaborate and it doesn&rsquo;t take into account economics. The city of Nashville recently had a dump that was cited by EPA. They went down to find out, what was it being cited for? And they told them, frankly we don&rsquo;t know. We can&rsquo;t find the records that lead to this citation and we&rsquo;re not exactly sure what it referenced. But it must be bad or we wouldn&rsquo;t have sent it out.: In Iowa they had a dust regulation underway because they control particulate matter. I do agree on clean air. There are things they should do that are right. But dust in Iowa is -- is an absurdity. And they were worried that the plowing of a cornfield would leave dust to go to another farmer&rsquo;s cornfield. And they were going to -- they were planning to issue a regulation. In Arizona they went in on the dust regulation and suggested to them that maybe if they watered down the earth, they wouldn&rsquo;t have these dust storms in the middle of the year. And people said to them, you know the reason it&rsquo;s called a desert...: ...is there&rsquo;s no water. Now this is an agency out of touch with reality which I believe is incorrigible and you need a new agency that is practical, has commonsense, uses economic factors and in the case of -- of pollution actually incentives change, doesn&rsquo;t just punish it.: Sure.: I&rsquo;m consistent because I think you ought to have fact- based campaigns to talk about the records.: Well, I think you have to look at the film, which I haven&rsquo;t seen. But if you look at &ldquo;The New York Times&rdquo; article, I think it was on Thursday, you would clearly have to say that Bain, at times, engaged in behavior where they looted a company, leaving behind 1,700 unemployed people. That&rsquo;s &ldquo;The New York Times.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s not me.: -- in 30 seconds.: Well, sure. Governor, I wish you would calmly and directly state it is your former staff running the PAC. It is your millionaire friends giving to the PAC. And you know some of the ads are -- aren&rsquo;t true. Just say that. It&rsquo;s straightforward.: Yes, but...: Good.: (INAUDIBLE).: You think my rhetoric was over-the-top, but your ads were totally reasonable? That&rsquo;s what I don&rsquo;t understand. Look...: I&rsquo;ve taken the governor&rsquo;s advice. : David, wait a second. Come on. Come on. I&rsquo;m glad finally on this stage, weeks later, he has said, gee, if they&rsquo;re wrong, they should take them down. They would have course -- we&rsquo;ve sent a letter in South Carolina saying -- warning the stations to just fact-check them before they start running them.
