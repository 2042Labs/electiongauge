David, I&rsquo;m very proud of the record that I have, and I think the one thing you can&rsquo;t fool the people about New Hampshire about is the record of a governor next door. And people have watched me over my term as governor and saw that I was a solid conservative and that I brought important change to Massachusetts. : We also got our state police to enforce illegal immigration laws, put in place English immersion in our schools. I&rsquo;m very proud of the conservative record I have, and I think that&rsquo;s why some of the leading conservatives in today&rsquo;s world, who are fighting the conservative battles of today, that don&rsquo;t have any axe to grind, have gotten behind my campaign.: Well, a lot of things were inaccurate in that, and I&rsquo;m not going to go through them one by one. But I can tell you this: I think it&rsquo;s unusual and perhaps understandable that people who spend their life in politics imagine that if you get in politics, that that&rsquo;s all you want to do, that if you&rsquo;ve been elected to something, well, you get -- want to get re-elected and re-elected.: It&rsquo;s still -- it&rsquo;s still my time. : Rick, Rick, it&rsquo;s still my time.: OK.: And so -- no, as the president of the United States, as the president of the United States, if I&rsquo;m elected, of course I&rsquo;ll fight for a second term. There&rsquo;s a lot of work to be done.: Mr. Speaker, citizenship has always been on my mind and -- and I happened to see my dad run for governor when he was 54-years- old. He had good advice to me. He said, Mitt, never get involved in politics if you have to win an election to pay a mortgage. If you find yourself in a position where you can serve, well you ought to have a responsibility to do so, if you think you can make a difference.: They&rsquo;ve got my record as governor. That -- that&rsquo;s the great thing of people here in New Hampshire is they see what I did as governor of Massachusetts. I also had the occasion after my last failed attempt to run for president, a learning experience, to sit down and write a book. And I wrote a book and described my view for the country. And people can describe it in differing ways but I -- but my view is that -- that the principles that I&rsquo;ve learned in business and the principles as governor, frankly, it made me more conservative as time has gone on. : Well, who knows more about tax policy?: -- I cut -- I cut programs, a whole series of programs, by -- by the way, the number one to cut is ObamaCare. That saves $95 billion a year.: Return this -- as Rick indicated -- return to states a whole series of programs -- food stamps, housing vouchers, Medicaid. And then set how much goes to them.: Yeah I was governor of a state that had a slightly democratic leaning House and Senate.: My legislature was 85 percent Democrat. And I went around at the very beginning of having been elected and met with the Speaker of the House and the Senate president. The Senate president said something I won&rsquo;t forget, he said, Mitt the campaign is over. The people expect us to now govern for them. And we did. We met every week. We rotated in offices. We got to know each other personally. We developed a relationship of respect and rapport, even though we disagreed on a lot of issues.: Well, what we don&rsquo;t need is to have a -- a federal government saying we&rsquo;re going to solve all of the problems of poverty across the entire country, because the -- what it means to be poor in Massachusetts is different than Montana and Mississippi and other places in the country.: What -- what unfortunately happens is with all the multiplicity of federal programs, you have massive overhead with government bureaucrats in Washington administering all these programs, very little of the money that&rsquo;s actually needed by those that really need help, those that can&rsquo;t care for themselves, actually reaches them.: And let states care for their own people in the way they feel best.: Andy, as you know, I don&rsquo;t discriminate, and in the appointments that I made when I was governor of Massachusetts, a member of my cabinet was gay. I appointed people to the bench regardless of their sexual orientation, made it very clear that, in my view, we should not discriminate in hiring policies and legal policies. : Right now. : Well, the carpenters union, for instance, trains their workers to be more effective on the job. And when they compete against nonunion workers, while they do that on a fair basis, if that happens, that&rsquo;s a positive contribution. : ... and to return America to a land of opportunity. : Well, I&rsquo;m not -- I&rsquo;m not familiar with the specific regulation as it -- as it applies to -- to New Hampshire. But I do believe that we have a responsibility to keep the air clean, and we have to find ways to assure that we don&rsquo;t have the pollution of one state overwhelming the -- the ability of another state to have clean air. : Well, of course it&rsquo;s former staff of mine. And, of course they&rsquo;re people who support me. They wouldn&rsquo;t be putting money into a PAC that supports me if they weren&rsquo;t people who support me.: Hold on a second. I -- I can&rsquo;t direct their ads. If there&rsquo;s anything in them that&rsquo;s wrong, I hope they take it out. I hope everything that&rsquo;s wrong...: -- is taken out.: It said that -- that you had sat down with Nancy Pelosi and -- and argued for -- for a climate change bill. That was correct. It said that you called the -- the Ron Paul&rsquo;s -- Ron Paul -- Paul Ryan&rsquo;s plan to bu -- to provide Medicare reform...: But I do think -- but I do think the rhetoric, Mr. Speaker, I think was a little over-the-top. : Again -- again...: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Speaker, the -- the super PACs that are out there running ads with Ron Paul&rsquo;s, mine, yours, as you know, that is not my ad. I don&rsquo;t write that ad. I can&rsquo;t tell them how to. : But, Mr. Speaker, but, Mr. Speaker, I wouldn&rsquo;t call someone the things you&rsquo;ve called me public. I think that&rsquo;s just over- the-top.
