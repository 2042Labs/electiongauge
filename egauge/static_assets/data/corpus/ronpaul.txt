You know, I think this whole discussion so far has been very superficial. And I think the question in the way that you ask it is superficial and you&rsquo;re talking about character, which is very important. But I feel we should deal with the issues as well. And I don&rsquo;t see how we can do well against Obama if we have any candidate that, you know, endorsed, you know, single payer systems and TARP bailouts and don&rsquo;t challenge the Federal Reserve&rsquo;s $15 trillion of injection bailing out their friends.: You know that demonstrates how out of touch the U.S. government and the U.S. Congress is with the American people. Because I&rsquo;m supporting things that help the American people.: That&rsquo;s the disgust that people have. Is because they keep growing government. Whether it&rsquo;s the Republicans in charge or the Democrats in -- in charge. But as far as working with other groups, I think my record is about as good as anybody&rsquo;s because I work on the principle that freedom and the Constitution bring people together, for different reasons. People use freedom in different ways like it does. It invites variations in our religious beliefs and economic beliefs.: We tell people that they&rsquo;re allowed to, you know, spend their money as they choose. On civil liberties, that&rsquo;s a different segment. Republican conservatives aren&rsquo;t all that well known for protecting privacy and personal liberties. When it comes to this spending overseas, I can work a coalition. Matter of fact, my trillion dollar proposal to cut spending, doesn&rsquo;t immediately deal with Social Security, it&rsquo;s to try to work our way out of Social Security.: It&rsquo;s not exactly a simple task to repeal approximately 100 years of us sliding away from our republic and still running a foreign policy of Woodrow Wilson, trying to make the world safe for democracy. And, look, we have elections overseas and we don&rsquo;t even accept the elections.: Right.: Well, subsidies per se are -- it&rsquo;s bad economic policy. It&rsquo;s bad moral policy, because it&rsquo;s using government force to transfer money from one group to another. And economically, it does a lot of harm.: Entitlements are not rights. Right mean you have a right...: ...rights mean you have a right to your life. You have a right to -- to your liberty and you should have a right to keep the fruits of your labor. And this is quite a bit different, but earlier on there was a little discussion here about gay rights. I in a way don&rsquo;t like to use those terms, gay rights, woman&rsquo;s rights, minority rights, religious rights. There&rsquo;s only one type of right. It&rsquo;s the right to your liberty. And I think this causes divisiveness when we see people in groups, because for too long we punish groups. So the answer then was, let&rsquo;s -- let&rsquo;s relieve them by giving them affirmative action. : I would continue to do what I&rsquo;m doing now, preaching the gospel of liberty. I think that the most important ingredients in this country that made us great was our founders understood what liberty meant. And that is what we need. We have deserted that. We have drifted a long way. It involves our right to our life, right to our liberty. We ought to be able to keep the fruits of our labor. We ought to understand property rights. We ought to understand contract rights. We ought to understand what sound money is all about, and we ought to understand what national defense means. That means defending this country. That is the bully pulpit we need. We need to defend liberty. : And liberty.
